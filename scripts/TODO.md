# Things to do with scripts

## Working with get_author_files.pl

* [ ] Download contributor information and then user information from
  the API to create a (cached) contributor data base.
* [ ] Complete documentation
* [ ] Account for committers. Check with clojurescript. 
* [ ]
  Use
  [Graph::Dijkstra](http://search.cpan.org/~ddallen/Graph-Dijkstra-0.70/lib/Graph/Dijkstra.pm) to
  convert to GML, which is easier for analysis with `igraph` (includes
  node attributes, not only ID).
  
* [ ] Create permanent user database for avoiding too many requests.
