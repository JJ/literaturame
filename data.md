#Data files

There is some data in this repo for other repositories I have forked
or have personally worked on. You can find them in the [`data`](data/)
directory divided by type or repo

* [`data/books`](data/books) includes data for books I've written,
  non-fiction or fiction. Although there is no such thing as
  non-fiction, don't you think?
  
* [`data/papers`](data/papers) has data on papers we have worked,
  generally in a collaborative way. We do open science, we do it in
  GitHub. and you should too.
  
* Finally, [`data/software`](data/software) includes data on Perl and
  JavaScript modules I have released, and other libraries I happened
  to have forked, in Python and NQP.
