#Contributing to this repo

It would help if you contributed data files to this work, to have as many data points as possible. You can make this data big. No pun intended. Well, some pun intended.

To add published data files, just fork and add a pointer to it, along with whatever context you want to add, to the [`data.md`](data.md) file

## Add your code

There are two different languages in this repo: Perl and R. If you are proficient in either of them, check them out and patch them or add functionality. Although I don't guarantee that I'll incorporate the latter if they don't meet some requirement I'm interested in, by all means do submit the patch and I'll check it out.

Anyway,
*[`scripts/`](scripts/) contains Perl scripts for extracting commit
diffs, word count diffs and other stuff.
*[`stats`/](stats/) contains R and Rmarkdown scripts to generate
reports and compute different statistical measures. By no means this
is complete, so feel quite free to add stuff in this place.
